"What have men loved if it wasn't me? Can I ever find out who I am or what I am if I don't let beauty perish and live on in whatever flesh age gives me?" --The Burning of the Brain, Cordwainer Smith
"The psychotic does not merely think he sees four blue bivalves with floppy wings wandering up the wall; he does see them. A hallucination is not, strictly speaking, manufactured in the brain; it is received by the brain, like any 'real' sense datum, and the patient act in response to this to-him-very-real perception of reality in as logical a way as we do to our sense data. In any way to suppose he only 'thinks he sees it' is to misunderstand totally the experience of psychosis." --Philip K. Dick
